<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description
>
>  
> This repository servers as a codebase for various augmentations that can be applied to time series data. In this repository, we have provided code for traditional as well as deep learning basd augmentations. Testing and results are generated with four different datasets.

<!-- SETUP -->
## Setup

> `### <<< DELETE ME:` ***Setup***
>  
> Below are some base instructions for setting up a conda environment. See this
> [guide](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists/)
> to Conda to learn some great best practices!
> 
> Add any instructions necessary to setup the project. The best time to create
> this is ***as you are developing*** the project, while you remember the steps
> you have taken.
>
> *Brownie points*: try to follow your setup instructions to replicate the setup
> from scratch on another machine to ensure that it is truly reproducible.
